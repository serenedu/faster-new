# Faster New File And Folder

VSCode extension for faster file and folder creation.

## Feature

By default, VSCode only allows you to create files and folders only if the source being right-clicked is a folder. This extension enables you to create them even if the source is a file. The newly created file or folder will appear at the same level as the source file.
